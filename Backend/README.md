# QuikResponse Back-End

## A Note From Mike Mehl

Here's a little thing I've started. 
This uses Flask with a few extensions to make our lives easier:

   * flask - your bread and butter 
   * flask_restful - define resources as classes with methods for handling http requests 
   * ~~flask_sqlalchemy - ORM for SQL databases~~
   * peewee - simple ORM for SQL databases

## Documentation

All of these packages have pretty good documentation. 
Below are the pages I used as starting points:

   * [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/quickstart/)
   * [Flask-RESTful](https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html)
   * ~~[Flask-SQLAlchemy](http://flask-sqlalchemy.pocoo.org/2.3/quickstart/)~~
   * [peewee](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/quickstart.html)
